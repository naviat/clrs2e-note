\section*{Solution to Exercise 17.3-6}

We will implement a queue $Q$ with two ordinary stacks $\id{S}[Q]$ and
$\id{T}[Q]$, so that the operations of \proc{Enqueue} and
\proc{Dequeue} are implemented as below:

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{\proc{Enqueue}$(Q, x)$}
\li \proc{Push}$(\id{S}[Q])$
\end{codebox}

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{\proc{Dequeue}$(Q)$}
\li \If \proc{Stack-Empty}$(\id{T}[Q])$
\li   \Then
        \If \proc{Stack-Empty}$(\id{S}[Q])$
\li       \Then
            \Error ``underflow''
\li       \Else
            \Repeat
\li           $x \gets \proc{Pop}(\id{S}[Q])$
\li           \proc{Push}$(\id{T}[Q])$
\li         \Until \proc{Stack-Empty}$(\id{S}[Q])$
          \End
      \End
\li \Return \proc{Pop}$(\id{T}[Q])$
\end{codebox}

We will also define $\Phi(D_i)$ to be the number of objects in
$\id{S}[Q]$ after the $i$th operation, and $\Phi(D_0) = 0$. The
argument of the amortized costs is omitted.

$m$ units of potential can pay for rebuilding an $m$-node subtree.
That means it costs $m$ units of actual time to rebuild an $m$-node
subtree. Since a 1/2-balanced tree has potential 0, the amortized time
to rebuild an $m$-node tree is $m + 0 - \Phi(T') = m - \Phi(T')$
where $T'$ is the tree to rebuild. The upper bound of this amortized
time can be determined by calculating the lower bound of $\Phi(T')$.

As we know, a subtree is rebuilt only when an insertion or deletion
breaks the balance. Therefore, we have

\begin{eqnarray*}
\Phi(T')
& \geq & c \Delta(\id{root}[T']) \\
& = & c (\alpha m - (1-\alpha) m) \\
& = & (2\alpha - 1)cm.
\end{eqnarray*}

If we want the amortized time to be $O(1)$, then we must have $m -
\Phi(T') \leq \beta$, i.e. $\Phi(T') \geq m - \beta$, where $\beta$ is
some constant. This inequality can be guaranteed by letting $(2\alpha
- 1)cm \geq m - \beta$, i.e., $c \geq 1/(2\alpha
- 1) - \beta/((2\alpha - 1)m)$.

Therefore, it takes $O(1)$ amortized time to rebuild a subtree that is
not $\alpha$-balanced as long as $c \geq 1/(2\alpha - 1)$.
