\textbf{Why dynamic programming is called ``dynamic''?}

I think that's because in a dynamic programming approach, the choice
made for a problem depends on the choices made for its subproblem(s).
Think of the difference between a static web page and a dynamic web
page: the output of a dynamic web page depends on user's input, while
the output of a static web page doesn't.
