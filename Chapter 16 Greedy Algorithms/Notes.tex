In Section 16.4, a matroid is defined as an ordered pair $M = (S,l)$.
The \LaTeX code to print the symbol of $l$ in the text book is
\texttt{\char92}mathcal\{l\}, with package \textsf{mathtime} included
in the preamble.  This information is got from the email from Thomas
H. Cormen (the first author of the text book).  

\section*{Nov 14, 2009}

I find a bug in Section 16.4, which is located at line 11 from the
bottom on page 400. The statement ``(2) implies that the $i$th largest
deadline is at least $i$'' should be changed to ``(2) implies that the
$i$th smallest (earliest) deadline in $A$ is at least $i$, otherwise
we will have $N_{i-1}(A) > i-1$ which is contradictory.''
