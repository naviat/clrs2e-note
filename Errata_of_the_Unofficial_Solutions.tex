\section*{Error of Solution to Exercise 4.2-1}

The proof by substitution hasn't proved the exact form of the inductive 
hypothesis, that is, $T(n) \leq c n^{\lg3} - cn$. Actually, it's difficult to 
prove it.



\section*{Error of Solution to Exercise 4.2-3}

$T(n) = \Omega(n^2)$ hasn't been proved.



\section*{Error of Solution to Exercise 8.2-4}

$C[b] - C[a]$ gives how many of the $n$ integers fall into a range $(a
\twodots b]$, but not $[a \twodots b]$.



\section*{Error of Solution to Exercise 12.3-1}
The pointer $p$ (pointer to the parent) can not be updated by this
implementation.
