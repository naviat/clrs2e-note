\section*{Solution to Exercise 23.1-2}

Suppose there's an {\bf acyclic} path from $s$ to $v$ being $<v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_k>$,
where $v_0 = s$ and $v_k = v$. Similarly with the proof of lemma 24.2, the path has at
most $|V| - 1$ edges, and so $k \leq |V| - 1$. Each of the $|V| - 1$ iterations of the
\For loop of lines 2-4 relaxes all $E$ edges. Among the edges relaxed in the $i$th
iteration, for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$, is $(v_{i - 1}, v_i)$, and $d[v_i]$ becomes finite.
Therefore, $d[v_k] = d[v]$ will become finite no later than the $k$th iteration.

The opposite direction can be proved by appealing to the no-path property (Corollary
24.12).
